1. Make a folder named ".json to .csv".

2. Upload the **converter.py** and **output.csv** (make sure the file is empty) files in
   .json to .csv folder along with the Spotify history files should lokk smt like **StreamingHistory_music_0**.

3. Your folder should now look smt like this
<pre> ```  
     📁 .json to .csv
     ├── converter.py
     ├── output.csv
     ├── StreamingHistory_music_0.json
     ├── StreamingHistory_music_1.json
     └── ... (any other StreamingHistory files) 
   ``` </pre>

4. Now Install the Required Library-

   * go to terminal (click Windows+R and type cmd and enter)
   * then paste this command "pip install pandas"

5. Go to .json to .csv folder right click on it and open terminal
   and paste this command "python converter.py" and press enter.
   
6. Hopefully now the json files are converted to csv files and saved in output.csv file.

7. If any issue check the file name in the convert.py , or check the README.md to contact.
